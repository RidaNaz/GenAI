# Artificial Intelligence

### - Natural Language Processing NLP -> Text based
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the discipline of bulding machines that can manipulate human language - or data that resembles human language - in the way that it is written, spoken and organized.

- Computer Vision -> Image & Video based
- Speech Recognition -> Speech & Audio based



## 1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence ANI
### 1. Descriminative AI
- Learn decision boundaries to classify or predict outcomes
- Identify patterns to separate classes
- Primarily used for classification, prediction, and regression
- **Algorithms:**
    - Logistic Regression
    - SVMs
    - Random Forests
    - Neural Networks
    - Decision Trees

### 2. Generative AI
- Learn data distributions to generate new samples
- Model underlying data generation process
- Used for generation, sampling, and unsupervised learning
- **Algorithms:**
    - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
    - Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
    - Autoregressive Models
    - Transformers
    - Diffusion Models

#### Gen AI Algorithms

- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**   Generate new data by pitting two neural networks against each other.
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):**   Learn to generate new data similar to training data.
- **Transformer Models:**   Use attention mechanisms for generating text (e.g., GPT-3, BERT).
- **Diffusion Models:**   Generate high-quality images by iteratively refining random noise.
- **Neural Style Transfer:**   Combines content and style from different images to create new ones.

## 2. Artificial General Intelligence AGI
- AGI has not been achieved yet
- AGI would be able to perform any intellectual task that a human can, and potentially even surpass human capabilities in many areas.
- There are five steps to achieve AGI:

## Types of AI Models
### 1. LLM (Large Language Model) / GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformers)

- Neural networks trained on large text corpora to understand and generate human-like text.
- **Applications:** Text generation, translation, summarization.
- **Examples:**
    - ChatGPT
    - Bard / Gemini

### 2. Diffusion Models / Latent Diffusion Model 

- Generative models that create high-quality data samples by iteratively refining random noise.
- **Applications:** Image generation, data augmentation.
- **Examples:** Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)

## Tips of effective Prompt Engineering

- **Be explicit :**   Clearly specify the desired format or output.
- **Provide Context :**   Offer relevant information or background to guide the model.
- **Control Output Length :**   Instruct the model to generate responses of a specific length.
- **Restrict responses :**   Utilize techniques like temperature adjustment to refine output quality.
- **Experiment and Iterate :**   Refine prompts through experimentation and feedback loops.
